## Red, green, refactor
* Write a failing test (red)
* Make it pass (green)
* Refactor
* Rinse
* Repeat

#### Unit vs (Feature|End to End|Acceptance) Tests

---

## Where to start?
* Unit = Inside Out
* Acceptance = Outside In

---

## Why Outside In?

---

## Because I'm not smart enough
* If start with units I'm guessing what my UI needs
* I'm bad at guessing

---

## Let's try it!
* A simple web component to score bowling
* A text box
* A button
* Display the score

---

## To start
* https://github.com/gaslight/tddlab
* clone
* npm start

---

### Just enough Web Componentry to be dangerous...

---

## Let's write a failing test!

---

## Let's make it pass
